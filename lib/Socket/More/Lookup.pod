=head1 NAME

Socket::More::Lookup - System DNS lookup routines

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Socket::More::Lookup;
  use Socket::More::Constants;

  # Converte a host name to one or more address structures
  my $res=getaddrinfo( "www.google.com", 80, {family=>AF_INET}, my @results);
  die gai_strerror($!) unless $res;

  # Convert an addres structure to a hostname and port
  my $res=getnameinfo($addr, my $host="", my $port="", $flags);
  die gai_strerror($!) unless $res;


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Bindings to getaddrinfo, getnameinfo, gai_strerror with calling a convention
more inline with the C library, and Perl's 'sys*' subroutines. That is, the
return value of get*info is 'true' value on success and C<undef> on failure,
with C<$!> containing the error code.

The actual results are stored arguments, not returned as a combined err/results
list like the L<Socket> implementation.

This module is part of L<Socket::More> but exists as a standalone package for
better reuse and smaller memory footprint 


=head1 API

=head2 getaddrinfo

  my $res=getaddrinfo($host, $port, $hints, @results)

Calls the C<getaddrinfo> library function to resolve the address information of
C<$host>. The C<$port> variable is filled into the resulting address structure.

The address structures returned are influenced by the C<$hints> hash with keys
B<flags>, B<family>, B<type> and B<protocal>. Please refer to the man page of
getaddrinfo for details.

Results, if any are are stored in C<@results>. Each entry in the results array
is a hash with the keys B<family>, B<type>, B<protocal>, B<addr> and
C<cannonname>. Please refer to the main page of getaddrinfo for details.

Returns true on success, on C<undef> on failure. In the later case C<$!> is set
to the numeric error code, which can then be converted to a string via
C<gai_strerror>.




=head2 getnaminfo

  my $res=getnameinfo($sock_addr, $host, $port);
  my $res=getnameinfo($sock_addr, my $host="", my $port="",$flags);

Calls the C<getnameinfo>library function to convert a known address structure
to a host and port. The resulting hostname and port number are stored in the
arguments C<$host> and C<$port>. This must be defined string and writable
variables.

The output is influenced by the C<$flags> argument. Please refer to the man
page of getnameinfo for details.

Returns true on success, on undef on failure. In the later case C<$!> is set to
the numeric error code, which can then be converted to a string via
C<gai_strerror>


=head2 gai_strerror

  my $string=gai_strerror($code)

Converts a numerical error code returned from either getaddrinfo or getnameinfo
into a human readable string. Please refer to man page of gai_strerror for more
details
